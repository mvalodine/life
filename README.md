# Conway's Game of Life on MSP430

This project implements Conway's Game of Life on an MSP430 microcontroller. It displays the game grid on an LCD, handles switch inputs to control the simulation, and allows users to set initial seed patterns.

Features
- Game of Life Simulation: Implements the rules of Conway's Game of Life to simulate cellular automata.
- LCD Display: Displays the game grid in real-time on a connected LCD screen.
- Switch Input Handling: Allows the user to interact with the simulation using external switches.
- Customizable Seed Patterns: Users can set the initial state of the grid using predefined seed patterns or custom inputs.

Requirements
- MSP430 Microcontroller: Any MSP430 with sufficient I/O for switch input and LCD output.
- LCD Display: A compatible LCD screen for displaying the game grid.
- External Switches: For user interaction to control the simulation.
- C Compiler: A C compiler compatible with MSP430 (e.g., Code Composer Studio).

Usage
- Press switches to change the state of cells on the grid.
- Start or pause the simulation using the corresponding switches.
- View the evolving grid on the LCD screen.
